The input files to the program "hsv_sim" must be in the format 
<variable1> <value1>
<variable2> <value2>
...
With just one variable per line.  Some variables are integers while others use floating point foramt.
There is a sample input file in the Linux directory (hsv_sim.in).

The variables available for setting can be grouped into those for simulation control, graphical output,
fitting and fixed variables.  The variable names, sample values and descriptions are shown below in
groups identified by the above categories:

Fitting or "Drawn" Variables (_high/_low used based on Param_mask; _mean/_std used if PDF_on; otherwise uses "_init")
=====================================================================================
    Param_mask uses a bit mask where 2^0=var1,2^1=var2,etc... in the following order:
      beta,vburstrate,2^2=log p,c,theta,inf,rinf,delta,betae,rho,eclipse,betaun,Cmax,IC50,m,gamma,absorb
	so Param_mask=7 means vary beta, vburstrate and log p together using high/low range.
    (Note: high/low ranges also used by external scripts to guide fitting decisions - see scripts directory)
