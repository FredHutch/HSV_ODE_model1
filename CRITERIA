The criteria file is used to supply cohort statistics on HSV viral shedding from a given study.  The categories used are
listed below.  An example criteria file, hsv_sim.crit, is provided in the Linux directory.

The file contains 10 categories of criteria.  Each is divided into a number of bins (histograms).  The format for each bin is the
following (space delineated): target lower and upper 95% CIs and mean values.  The categories and bin counts are as follows:

1. Cumulative percent pos swabs (9 bins)
2. Episode rate (1 bin)
3. Maximum log VL histograms (8 bins)
4. First pos VL histograms (7 bins)
5. Last pos VL histograms (6 bins)
6. Avg rise rate (1 bin)
7. Avg fall rate (1 bin)
8. Episode duration (10 bins)
9. Avg reproductive number (1 bin)
10. Peak VLdistribution bins (10 bin)
