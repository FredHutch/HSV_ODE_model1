The program "hsv_sim" is builtin using "make" in the Linux subdirectory.  For building requirements, see the file BUILDING.
The program requires an input file (hsv_sim.in by default) and a "criteria" file (hsv_sim.crit by default).
The input file pairs input variable names with values placing one per line.  Names may appear multiple times,
but only the last value will be used.  In addition to fixed parameters, the user may supply upper and lower bounds
for a pre-defined set of parameters.  The program will attemot to optimize the output by performing a latin-
hypercube search of the parameter space.  This capability was abandoned early on for parallel searching on a cluster
using distributions of variable values that were appended to input files in multiple directories which were then used 
to obtain scored outputs in a parallel fashion.  Input variable details are provided in the file INPUTS.  Some scripts 
used in fitting pairs of parameters are included in the scripts directory and described in the README.md file therein.

The criteria file is used to supply cohort statistics on HSV viral shedding from a given study.  The categories used are
detailed in the file CRITERIA.

Finally, the program can be used to generate several different output files.  The most basic (set with -w 1 option)
contains time history date for overall viral load.  Other files can be used to output other summary statistics or
statistics by spatial region.  There are 200 spatial regions by default, layed out as a hexagonally "hive".

Usage: ./hsv_sim [-h][-d][-b][-f <input_file>][-c <crit file>][-n <cells>[-r][-s <seed>][-v][-w <write_mask>][-W <crit><weight>]
	-h = this help
	-f = optional input file
	-c = optional criteria file
