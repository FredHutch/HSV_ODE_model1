The program "hsv_sim" is builtin using "make" in the Linux subdirectory.  For building requirements, 
see the file BUILDING.  When running you may need to load the Mesa module and put "lib" directory of
the directory you set in the GTKGLEXT environment variable (see BUILDING) in the front of the path
specified by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (see sample export command below).

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$GTKGLEXT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

The program requires an "input" file (hsv_sim.in by default) and a "criteria" file (hsv_sim.crit by default).
The input file contains input variable names and values placing one per line.  Names may appear multiple times,
but only the last value will be used.  If a variable is not recognized, it is ignored.  Blank lines
and comments are not allowed in this version.  In addition to fixed parameters, the user may supply 
upper and lower bounds for a pre-defined set of parameters.  The program has an option to sample from
the ranges on these parameters in an attempt to optimize the output by performing a latin-
hypercube search of the parameter space.  This capability is deprecated.  It was abandoned early on for 
a strategy that allowed for parallel searching with pairs of variables done over multiple rounds.
Some of the scripts used have been put in the scripts directory of this repository and are
described in the README.md file therein.

Input variable details are provided in the file INPUTS.  

The criteria file is used to supply cohort statistics on HSV viral shedding from a given study.  
The categories used are detailed in the file CRITERIA.

Finally, the program can be used to generate several different output files.  The most basic 
contains time history date for overall viral load.  Other files can be used to output other 
summary statistics or statistics by spatial region (files are specified using the -w option 
with a bit-wise mask value).  

There are 300 spatial regions simulated by default, layed out hexagonally as a "hive".
