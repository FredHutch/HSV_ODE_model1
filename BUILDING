   The simplest way to compile the required objects and executable is to do the following:

  1. "cd" to the "Linux" directory containing the package's source code and type

  2. Set GTKGLEXT environment variable to location of gtkglext installation (required)
     Alternatively, you can clone the GIT repository using the command below and set the 
     environment variable to the extra_libs directory contained in it. 

     git clone https://github.com/FredHutch/HSV_models

  3. Load Mesa module (if UBUNTU) - "ml Mesa"

        Depending on your UBUNTU version other modules may also be required including:
        GSL,GLib,GTK+ (2.x),libGLU and Pango (version with pangox)

  4. Type `make' to compile the hsv_sim executable.

Note: This early version of the C++ program uses GTK+ version 2.x and has not been ported to GTK+ 3.0.
